INTRODUCTION                                    *vinegar*

> Split windows and the project drawer go together like oil and vinegar.
> I don't mean to say that you can combine them to create a delicious
> salad dressing. I mean that they don't mix well!

by Drew Neil, 2013

vinegar.vim enhances netrw, partially in an attempt to mitigate the 
need for more disruptive "project drawer" style plugins.

Frequently Asked Questions                        *vinegar-faq*

Q: I miss the netrw banner.

A: All that annoying crap at the top is turned off,
   leaving you with nothing but a list of files.
   This is surprisingly disorienting, but ultimately
   very liberating.
   
   Press I to toggle until you adapt.

Q: How can I hide dotfiles by default?

A: Add to your vimrc 

     let g:netrw_list_hide = '\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'
     
  before vinegar.vim is loaded.

Q: How can I hide certain file types?

A: The netrw variable g:netrw_list_hide is deliberately
   overwritten by vinegar.vim. Use |'wildignore'| for this.
   
   Note: Setting wildignore has to be done
         before vinegar.vim is loaded.

Q: How can I hide files specified in gitignore?

A: Add to your vimrc

    let &wildignore = join(map(split(substitute(substitute(
  \ netrw_gitignore#Hide(), '\.\*', '*', 'g'), '\\.', '.', 'g'),
  \ ','), "v:val.','.v:val.'/'"), ',')
  
  before vinegar.vim is loaded.
  
  Note: If you invoke vim not in your git project, only
        the global gitignore is taken into account.
        If you switch to a directory of different git
        project, the local gitignore of this project is
        not taken into account.
        For more details see |netrw-gitignore|.

Q: How does vinegar sort the listing?

A: The oddly C-biased default sort order by netrw and file hiding
   is replaced with a sensible application of 'suffixes' and
   'wildignore'.
   
Q: I want to map Esc to bring me back to the last buffer.

      autocmd FileType netrw nmap <buffer> <esc> <C-^>
