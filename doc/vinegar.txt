INTRODUCTION                                                    *vinegar*

> Split windows and the project drawer go together like oil and vinegar.
> I don't mean to say that you can combine them to create a delicious
> salad dressing. I mean that they don't mix well!

by Drew Neil, 2013

vinegar.vim enhances netrw, partially in an attempt to mitigate the 
need for more disruptive "project drawer" style plugins.

-                      Press - in any buffer to hop up to the directory 
                       listing and seek to the file you just came from.
                       Keep bouncing to go up, up, up. Having rapid
                       directory access available changes everything.

                                                              *vinegar-.*
.                      Press . on a file to pre-populate it at the end
                       of a : command line.
                       This is great, for example, to quickly initiate
                       a :grep of the file or directory under the cursor.

                                                              *vinegar-!*
!                      Press ! on a file to pre-populate it at the end
                       of a :! command line.
                       Type !chmod +x and get :!chmod +x path/to/file.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS                                  *vinegar-faq*

Q: I miss the |g:netrw_banner|.

A: All that annoying crap at the top is turned off, leaving you with
   nothing but a list of files. This is surprisingly disorienting, but
   ultimately very liberating.
   
   Press I to toggle until you adapt.


Q: How can I hide dotfiles by default?

A: Add to your vimrc 

     `let g:netrw_list_hide = '\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'`
     
  before vinegar.vim is loaded.


Q: How can I hide certain file types?

A: The netrw variable `g:netrw_list_hide` is deliberately overwritten by
   |vinegar.vim|. Use |'wildignore'| for this.
   
   E.g., add to your vimrc
   
      `set wildignore+=*.pyc`
      
  before vinegar.vim is loaded.
   
   Note: Setting 'wildignore' has to be done before
         |vinegar.vim| is loaded. This also means changes
         later on, e.g. `$VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/python.vim`,
         adjusts 'wildignore' for *.pyc when opening a python
         file, do not influence the behaviour of vinegar
         anymore.


Q: How can I hide files specified in gitignore?

A: Add to your vimrc

   ```
   let &wildignore = join(map(split(substitute(substitute(
      \ netrw_gitignore#Hide(), '\.\*', '*', 'g'), '\\.', '.', 'g'),
      \ ','), "v:val.','.v:val.'/'"), ',')
   ```
  
  before |vinegar.vim| is loaded.
  
  Note: If you invoke vim not in your git project, only the
        global gitignore is taken into account; even if you
        later change the pwd to your git project. Only if you
        invoke vim in your git project, the local gitignore
        is taken into account.  The reason for this is that
        vim only evaluates the above given expression for
        'wildignore' on startup.  All directory changes which
        would affect the evaluation of `netrw_gitignore#Hide()`
        are therefore ignored.
        For more details how gitignore files are found see
        |netrw-gitignore|.


Q: How does vinegar sort the listing?

A: The oddly C-biased default sort order by netrw and file hiding is
   replaced with a sensible application of 'suffixes' and 'wildignore'.
   

Q: I want to map Esc to bring me back to the last buffer.

A: Put following in your vimrc

    `autocmd FileType netrw nmap <buffer> <esc> <C-^>`
 

Q: I want to see line numbers.

A: Put following in your vimrc

   `let g:netrw_bufsettings = 'noma nomod nu nowrap ro nobl'`
